Tasdks is composed of tasks, activators and executions.

## Tasks

Tasks are the main building block of Tasdks.
They can be as simple as "Buy milk" or as complex as "Write a novel".

If a task is too complex it must be [divided](../creating-tasks/#when-to-divide-a-task-into-subtasks) into [Sub-tasks](#SubTask)

A task can be of two types, or a combination of both:

- [Parent task](#ParentTask)
- [Sub-task](#SubTask)



### Parent task {#ParentTask}

Is a task that has one or more sub-tasks.

### SubTask {#SubTask}

Is a task that is part of a parent task.
