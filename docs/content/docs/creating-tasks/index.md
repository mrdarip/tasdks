## When to divide a task into subtasks {#when-to-divide-a-task-into-subtasks}

When a task is too complex or too long, it is a good idea to divide it into subtasks. This makes the task easier to understand and manage.

There are several reasons why you might want to divide a task into subtasks:

- **Complexity**: If a task is too complex, it can be difficult to understand what needs to be done. By dividing the task into smaller subtasks, you can break it down into more manageable pieces, making it easier to understand and complete.
- **Length**: If a task is too long, it can be overwhelming to work on. By dividing the task into smaller subtasks, you will feel rewarded as you complete each subtask, helping you stay motivated and focused.
